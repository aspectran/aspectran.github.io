### New Features

*   **Thymeleaf Non-Servlet Environment Support**
    - The `with-thymeleaf` module has been refactored to fully support the `TowActivity` (embedded Undertow) environment, which does not depend on the Servlet API.
    - A new `com.aspectran.thymeleaf.context.tow` package has been created to implement Thymeleaf context objects specialized for `TowActivity`.
    - All features of Thymeleaf can now be used seamlessly in an embedded Undertow environment without a servlet container.

### Enhancements

*   **EclipseLink Integration Test and SQL Logging Configuration**
    - Added an integration test case with EclipseLink to the `with-jpa` module to improve stability.
    - Improved the development experience by adding a configuration to log SQL statements during tests, making it easier to debug JPA behavior.
