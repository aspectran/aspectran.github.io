### üöÄ Key Enhancements

*   **Bean Scope Management and Concurrency Performance**
  *   Optimized the locking strategy when creating beans via `FactoryBean`, significantly reducing unnecessary contention and improving performance in concurrent environments. This ensures better throughput in multi-threaded applications.
  *   Removed API restrictions on `SessionScope` to allow manual destruction of specific bean instances, increasing usability in scenarios like sticky sessions.

*   **Refactoring Across Core Components**
  *   **Session Management**: Refactored the Lettuce-based session store by abstracting common logic to reduce code duplication and modernized terminology from "Master-Replica" to "Primary-Replica".
  *   **MyBatis Integration**: Improved the internal structure of the MyBatis integration module by clarifying responsibilities and increasing maintainability.
  *   **Internal Logic**: Enhanced the stability of several utility classes, such as introducing a `JsonParser` to separate JSON processing logic and improving error handling in `RestRequest`.

*   **Shell and Daemon Environment Stability**
  *   Greatly improved stability in the development environment by fixing several critical bugs that occurred during a shell `restart`.
  *   Enhanced usability in scripted environments by allowing the `quit` command to exit immediately without a prompt in non-interactive mode, and optimized performance by caching interactive mode detection logic.

*   **Code Quality and Documentation**
  *   Significantly improved the developer experience by extensively adding and refining Javadoc comments across the project and making internal logging and user messages clearer and more consistent.
  *   Clarified API roles by renaming the resource release method in `EmbeddedAspectran` from `release()` to `destroy()`.

### üêû Key Bug Fixes

*   **Bean and Profile Configuration Correctness**
  *   Strengthened validation to prevent configuration errors by ignoring and issuing a warning if `@Profile` or other configuration annotations are used without the `@Component` annotation.
  *   Fixed a critical bug in `SessionScope` that incorrectly matched beans by class name instead of ID, resolving unpredictable behavior, especially in clustered environments.
  *   Resolved an issue where a `NoUniqueBeanException` would occur when multiple profiled beans were present, ensuring profile-based bean selection works correctly.

*   **Service Lifecycle Bugs**
  *   **Shell Restart Failures**: Fixed critical bugs that caused the shell to terminate unexpectedly or logging to fail after a `restart` command due to issues in the asynchronous shutdown process of the embedded Jetty server and Logback context handling.
  *   **Request Handling During Startup**: Improved stability by making incoming requests wait for service startup to complete, instead of rejecting them.

*   **Other Important Fixes**
  *   Fixed a `NotSerializableException` in `ConcurrencyThrottleSupport`.
  *   Fixed a bug where the Quartz scheduler was not created under certain conditions and added logic to prevent re-initialization.
