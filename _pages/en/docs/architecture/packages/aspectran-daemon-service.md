## 1. Design Goals and Key Roles

This package provides specialized service implementations for running Aspectran as an **independent background process (daemon)** without a web server. The design goals of this package are as follows:

-   **Provide an Independent Execution Environment**: Provides a foundation for building standalone applications that have their own lifecycle, without relying on a web container.
-   **Proactive Request Execution Model**: Unlike `WebService`, which reacts to external HTTP requests, it implements a **proactive execution model** where specific internal logic or a scheduler directly triggers translet execution.
-   **Programmatic Entry Point**: Provides clear and controllable entry points through `translate()` methods, allowing translets to be called programmatically from within the code.
-   **Session Functionality Support in Non-Web Environments**: Optionally provides session management functionality to allow long-running applications like daemons to maintain state across multiple `translate()` calls.

In conclusion, this package aims to enable the full utilization of Aspectran's powerful features (AOP, DI, etc.) in UI-less server applications such as background tasks, batch processes, and message queue listeners.

## 2. Detailed Analysis of Key Classes and Interfaces

### `DaemonService` (Interface)

The specification for Aspectran services specialized for the daemon environment.

**Key Responsibilities:**
-   Inherits `CoreService` to possess all core service functionalities.
-   Defines `translate(...)` methods, which are the core entry points for programmatically executing translets. These methods are the primary way for daemon applications to call internal services.
-   Defines the `newSessionAdapter()` method for creating a session adapter (`SessionAdapter`) for the daemon environment.

### `DefaultDaemonService` (Implementation Class)

The final implementation of `DaemonService`, responsible for receiving programmatic translet calls and handling the entire process of creating and executing `DaemonActivity`.

**Key Responsibilities:**
-   Inherits `DefaultCoreService` to act as a fully functional core service.
-   Creates and manages `DefaultSessionManager` according to the `DaemonConfig` settings, allowing session simulation even in a daemon environment.
-   Provides security features through `RequestAcceptor`, which can limit the list of translets that can be called by `translate()` methods.

**Key Method Analysis:**
-   `translate(String transletName, ...)`: This class's core execution method. It plays a role equivalent to `WebService.service()` in a web environment.
    1.  Checks if the service is in a paused state.
    2.  Checks if the requested `transletName` is allowed by `RequestAcceptor`.
    3.  Creates a `DaemonActivity` instance specialized for the daemon environment.
    4.  Sets the translet name, virtual HTTP method, attributes, parameters, etc., received by the `translate()` method into `DaemonActivity`.
    5.  Calls `activity.prepare()` and `activity.perform()` to drive Aspectran's standard request processing pipeline.
    6.  Returns the `Translet` object containing the execution result.

### `DefaultDaemonServiceBuilder` (Builder Class)

A factory class that creates and configures `DefaultDaemonService` instances.

**Key Responsibilities:**
-   Receives an `AspectranConfig` object, instantiates `DefaultDaemonService`, and injects the necessary configurations.
-   Configures `ServiceStateListener` to ensure that the service's lifecycle (start, stop, pause, etc.) is correctly integrated with `CoreServiceHolder` and `SessionManager`.

## 3. Interaction with Other Packages

-   **`com.aspectran.core.service`**: Directly inherits `DefaultCoreService` to reuse all of Aspectran's core functionalities (lifecycle, `ActivityContext` management, etc.).
-   **`com.aspectran.daemon.activity`**: `DefaultDaemonService` creates a `DaemonActivity` for every `translate()` call. `DaemonActivity` acts as an adapter that converts programmatic calls into a form that the core engine can understand.
-   **`com.aspectran.core.context.config`**: Reads daemon-specific configurations (session management, polling settings, etc.) from the `DaemonConfig` configuration object and applies them to the service.

## 4. Package Summary and Architectural Significance

The `com.aspectran.daemon.service` package plays a crucial role in transforming a reactive web framework into a **proactive application container**. While `WebService` waits for external requests, `DaemonService` provides a structure where the application itself can call its own logic (translets) as needed.

The `translate()` method is an **internal API call gateway** that architecturally performs the same role as a web request. All translets called through this method can receive all of Aspectran's features, such as aspects (transactions, security, etc.) and dependency injection, just like web requests.

Furthermore, providing session management functionality in a non-web environment is one of the unique features of this package. This allows for the effective construction of complex background applications that need to maintain state across multiple `translate()` calls.
