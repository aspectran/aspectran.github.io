## 1. Design Goals and Key Roles

This package provides the **`Activity` implementation that actually executes** command-line commands parsed by `ShellService`. The design goals of this package are as follows:

-   **Concretizing the Interactive Execution Environment**: Inherits from the abstract `CoreActivity` to provide `ShellActivity`, which can process requests in an interactive console I/O environment.
-   **Abstraction of Console I/O**: Through `ShellRequestAdapter` and `ShellResponseAdapter`, it converts command-line parameters and console output into standard request/response forms that the Aspectran core engine can understand.
-   **Support for Interactive Features**: Provides a prompt function that directly asks the user for input if essential parameters are missing for translet execution, completing the interactive experience.

In conclusion, this package acts as a **key bridge** between `ShellService` and `CoreActivity`, and is responsible for adapting user's command-line input to operate within Aspectran's standard execution pipeline.

## 2. Detailed Class Analysis

### `ShellActivity` (Implementation Class)

The final implementation of `Activity` for the interactive shell environment. A new instance is created each time `ShellService`'s `translate()` method is called.

**Key Responsibilities:**
-   Inherits `CoreActivity`, thus inheriting all of Aspectran's standard request processing pipeline (advice, action execution, etc.).
-   Maintains parsed request information from `TransletCommandLine` and a reference to `ShellConsole`.
-   Handles shell-specific features such as interactive parameter input and output redirection.

**Key Method Analysis:**
-   `adapt()`: The **core of adaptation for the shell environment**. It is called at the beginning of `CoreActivity`'s `perform()` method to convert command-line input into standard interfaces.
    -   `ShellRequestAdapter`: Wraps parameters and attributes contained in `TransletCommandLine` to act as a `RequestAdapter`.
    -   `ShellResponseAdapter`: Wraps the output `Writer` specified in `ShellService` (usually console or redirected file) to act as a `ResponseAdapter`.
-   `preProcedure()`: A unique logic of `ShellActivity` that is called before the `perform()` method is executed to handle interactive input. If `procedural` mode is enabled and an essential parameter (`mandatory="true"`) for translet execution is missing, this method calls `ShellConsole.prompt()` to display a prompt asking the user to directly input the value.

**Interaction with Other Classes:**
-   `ShellService`: Within its `translate()` method, it directly creates `ShellActivity`, sets parameters, and then calls `prepare()` and `perform()` to execute it.
-   `CoreActivity`: `ShellActivity` inherits `CoreActivity` and uses its execution pipeline as is.
-   `com.aspectran.shell.console.ShellConsole`: Used for all console I/O, such as displaying interactive prompts in `preProcedure()` or outputting final results via `ShellResponseAdapter`.
-   Classes in `com.aspectran.shell.adapter` package: `ShellRequestAdapter` and `ShellResponseAdapter` are directly created and used within the `adapt()` method.

## 3. Package Summary and Architectural Significance

The `com.aspectran.shell.activity` package is another important example demonstrating the flexibility of Aspectran's architecture. The core architectural significance of this package lies in **extending beyond simple adaptation to include environment-specific logic**.

While `WebActivity` and `DaemonActivity` primarily focus on the 'adapter' role of converting input/output targets, `ShellActivity` integrates a new feature, **interactive interaction**, into the `Activity`'s lifecycle through its unique `preProcedure()` stage. This shows that Aspectran's `Activity` model is designed not just to execute a fixed pipeline, but to extend the execution flow itself to meet the unique requirements of each environment.

Thanks to this design, developers can easily build command-line applications that provide rich interaction, as if using a dedicated CLI library, while still leveraging Aspectran's core functionalities.
