## 1. Design Goals and Key Roles

This package provides the **`Activity` implementation that actually executes** translet calls programmatically initiated from `DaemonService`. The design goals of this package are as follows:

-   **Concretizing the Execution Environment for Programmatic Calls**: Inherits from the abstract `CoreActivity` to provide `DaemonActivity`, which can process requests in a non-web context, specifically the daemon environment.
-   **In-Memory Simulation of Request/Response**: In a daemon environment without HTTP streams or console I/O, it provides adapters that simulate requests and responses using `Map` and `Writer`. This allows the `CoreActivity` execution pipeline to be reused as is, without code changes.
-   **Integration with `DaemonService`**: It is responsible for converting and connecting the parameters and attributes passed during a `DaemonService`'s `translate()` method call into a form usable by `Activity`.

In conclusion, this package acts as a **key bridge** between `DaemonService` and `CoreActivity`, and is responsible for adapting programmatic calls to operate within Aspectran's standard execution pipeline.

## 2. Detailed Class Analysis

### `DaemonActivity` (Implementation Class)

The final implementation of `Activity` for the daemon environment. A new instance is created each time `DaemonService`'s `translate()` method is called.

**Key Responsibilities:**
-   Inherits `CoreActivity`, thus inheriting all of Aspectran's standard request processing pipeline (advice, action execution, etc.).
-   Maintains the request name, method, attribute map, and parameter map passed via the `translate()` method as internal state.
-   Creates and manages request/response/session adapters specific to the daemon environment.

**Key Method Analysis:**
-   `adapt()`: The **core of adaptation for the daemon environment**. It is called at the beginning of `CoreActivity`'s `perform()` method to convert programmatic calls into standard interfaces.
    -   `DaemonRequestAdapter`: Wraps the `attributeMap` and `parameterMap` passed to the `translate()` method to act as a `RequestAdapter`. This allows `CoreActivity` to access data in the same way as if it were reading parameters and attributes from an external request.
    -   `DaemonResponseAdapter`: Internally wraps an `OutputStringWriter` to act as a `ResponseAdapter`. Results from `<echo>` actions, etc., are stored in this `Writer` instead of being output to a real network or console. After execution, the `translate()` method can return the content of this `Writer` as a result.
    -   `DefaultSessionAdapter`: If session management is enabled in the parent `DaemonService`, it creates a session adapter to support state persistence.

**Interaction with Other Classes:**
-   `DaemonService`: Within its `translate()` method, it directly creates `DaemonActivity`, sets parameters, and then calls `prepare()` and `perform()` to execute it.
-   `CoreActivity`: `DaemonActivity` inherits `CoreActivity` and uses its execution pipeline as is. The primary role of `DaemonActivity` is to connect the inputs and outputs of this pipeline to the daemon environment.
-   Classes in `com.aspectran.daemon.adapter` package: `DaemonRequestAdapter` and `DaemonResponseAdapter` are directly created and used within the `adapt()` method.

## 3. Package Summary and Architectural Significance

The `com.aspectran.daemon.activity` package is an important example demonstrating the flexibility of Aspectran's architecture. The core architectural significance of this package lies in the **abstraction and simulation of the request/response cycle**.

`DaemonActivity` simulates requests and responses using only pure Java objects (`Map`, `Writer`) without actual network I/O. `DaemonRequestAdapter` makes a `Map` appear like a 'request', and `DaemonResponseAdapter` makes a `Writer` appear like a 'response'. Thanks to this sophisticated adapter layer, the `CoreActivity` execution engine does not need to know whether the data it is processing comes from a real HTTP request or from a method call within the code.

This design provides the technical foundation for building powerful background services by reusing Aspectran's core functionalities (DI, AOP, transactions, etc.). In other words, by **absorbing all dependencies on the execution environment within the adapter layer**, it proves that the framework's core logic can be consistently reused in various scenarios.
